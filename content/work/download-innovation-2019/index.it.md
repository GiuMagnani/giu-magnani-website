UX/UI Design and Web Development for the Download Innovation 2019 event website. This event is organised by <a href="https://www.sorint.it/" rel="noopener" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Sorint.lab</a>, an Italian technology company from Bergamo, Italy.

The design was inspired by the concepts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art" rel="noopener" rel="noreferrer">Generative Art</a> and Technology Innovation through Creativity. I also developed a "chip" symbol, generated by the email of the users, at the moment of the event subscription. The symbols were designed by Beatrice Bramati.
