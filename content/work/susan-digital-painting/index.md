Digital painting of Susan con chaleco azul (Susan with blue sweater). I painted this portrait of my wife <3 with Adobe Photoshop, in about 6-8 hours approximately. I have been experimenting a lot lately in order to find a technique that I feel comfortable with and get better results in less time, as I tend to overcomplicate and rework my drawings too much.

## Process

![Adding flat colors to the sketch](susan-digital-painting-flat-colors.jpg)
<span class="caption">With the sketch in a separated layer, I start painting some flat colors with the multiply mode of Photoshop, so I can keep looking at the lines while I do this.</span>

![Adding some light and shadows to the flat colors](susan-digital-painting-basic-values.jpg)
<span class="caption">Using some references to see the zones of lights and shadows, I start a basic rendering of the colors with a big brush to avoid getting into many details for now. I also add some different colors to give some "life" to the painting (such as red in the cheeks, some blues near the eyes and yellow in the forehead.</span>

![Start rendering with an smaller brush](susan-digital-painting-4.jpg)

<span class="caption">Now it's time for details, adding some darker tones to sharp some edges and white spots for the brightest areas (eyes, glasses, lips, etc.).</span>

<span class="caption">This is the final result, I'm pretty happy with it. I'm going to keep trying doing similar digital portraits to keep improving my technique and familiarity with the brushes.</span>
