RoboThink is the worldâ€™s leading STEM edu-franchise. I built a totally customised website with WordPress and Elementor. Some of the included features are a locations page with custom search via AJAX and OpenStreetMaps integration, motion and scrolling animations, custom post types, multiple forms for leads generation, SEO, optimization for Google indexing and performance.
